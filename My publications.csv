We investigated (a) whether adolescents’ EC predicted rank-order change in their PT over time, or vice versa; (b) whether mothers’ empathy predicted relative increases in adolescents’ empathy; (c) whether adolescent gender moderated the over-time links from mothers’ to adolescents’ empathy; and (d) whether the rank-order stability of EC and PT over time differed within and between respondents. Adolescents’ EC positively predicted their PT over time, but not vice versa. Mothers’ PT positively predicted adolescent PT over time for girls, but not for boys. The rank-order stability of adolescents’ EC was greater than their PT. Maternal PT and EC were equally stable and were more stable than in adolescents. This study contributes the first empirical evidence that the developmental order of adolescents’ empathy runs from affective to cognitive empathy, in contrast to prior theoretical and experimental literature that has emphasized the reverse direction. It further provides the 1st longitudinal evidence of intergenerational empathy transmission. These findings support the notion that adolescence is a developmentally sensitive period for PT.

We further examined how these situational empathy inductions interact with preexisting empathic dispositions. To promote ecological validity, we conducted home visits to study conflict discussions about real disagreements in adolescent–mother relationships. We explored the roles of sex, age, and maternal support and power as covariates and moderators. Results indicated that the affective empathy manipulation had no significant effects on behavior, although a trend in the hypothesized direction suggested that affective empathy might promote active problem solving. The cognitive empathy manipulation led to lower conflict escalation and promoted other-oriented listening for adolescents low in dispositional cognitive empathy. State–trait interactions indicated that the empathy manipulations had significant effects on self-reported outcomes for adolescents lower in dispositional empathic concern. For these adolescents, both manipulations promoted outcome satisfaction, but only the cognitive manipulation promoted perceived fairness. This suggests that cognitive empathy, in particular, allows adolescents to distance themselves from the emotional heat of a conflict and listen to mothers’ point of view, leading to outcomes perceived as both satisfying and fair. These findings are relevant for interventions and clinicians because they demonstrate unique effects of promoting affective versus cognitive empathy. Because even these minimal manipulations promoted significant effects on observed behavior and self-reported outcomes, particularly for low-empathy adolescents, stronger structural interventions are likely to have marked benefits.",2017-06,3/22/2017 15:47,3/22/2017 15:47,3/22/2017 15:47,32-45,,,158,,Journal of Experimental Child Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\lissa102\Zotero\storage\BADWAJIR\S0022096516302235.html; C:\Users\lissa102\Zotero\storage\IZES8EXT\Van Lissa et al_2017_The effects of affective and cognitive empathy on adolescents’ behavior and.pdf,,,empathy; Conflict resolution; Adolescence; Adolescent-parent relationships; Experiment; Perspective taking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Effect of Narrative Perspective on Readers’ Engagement with a First-Person Narrator,DIEGESIS,,2195-2116,,https://www.diegesis.uni-wuppertal.de/index.php/diegesis/article/view/211,"Many claims have been advanced about the effects of specific narrative strategies on readers’ engagement with characters, but the available evidence is still limited. One question in particular stands out in the current debate. Is first-person narrative more or less conducive to empathy and trust for the protagonist than third-person, internally focalized narrative? This essay tackles this question by examining the effect of narrative perspective on readers’ responses to a complex, and potentially unreliable, character. To this end, we conducted an experimental study with 76 Dutch high-school students. Contrary to our predictions, the manipulation of narrative perspective did not affect empathy for the character, but did affect trust. We suggest that the increase in trust in third-person narrative depends on the external narrator’s authority, which validates the perspective of the protagonist. The essay discusses these and other findings, combining experimental research with a qualitative analysis of readers’ comments on the character.",6/11/2016,9/24/2016 15:36,12/21/2017 14:29,9/24/2016 15:36,2195-2116,,1,5,,,,,,,,,,,Copyright (c) 2016 DIEGESIS,,,,www.diegesis.uni-wuppertal.de,,,,C:\Users\lissa102\Zotero\storage\9IEQQC3J\Lissa et al. - 2016 - Difficult Empathy.

However, research has not addressed the potential emotional cost of adolescents' high empathy, particularly when relationships are characterized by more frequent conflict. The present 6-year longitudinal study (N = 467) investigated whether conflict with parents predicted emotion dysregulation more strongly for high-empathy adolescents than for lower-empathy adolescents. Emotion dysregulation was operationalized at both the experiential level, using mood diary data collected for 3 weeks each year, and at the dispositional level, using annual self-report measures. In line with predictions, we found that more frequent adolescent-parent conflict predicted greater day-to-day mood variability and dispositional difficulties in emotion regulation for high-empathy adolescents, but not for average- and low-empathy adolescents. Mood variability and difficulties in emotion regulation, in turn, also predicted increased conflict with parents. These links were not moderated by empathy. Moreover, our research allowed for a novel investigation of the interplay between experiential and dispositional emotion dysregulation. Day-to-day mood variability predicted increasing dispositional difficulties in emotion regulation over time, which suggests that experiential dysregulation becomes consolidated into dispositional difficulties in emotion regulation. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that, for high-empathy adolescents, conflict was a driver of this dysregulation consolidation process. Finally, emotion dysregulation played a role in overtime conflict maintenance for high-empathy adolescents. This suggests that, through emotion dysregulation, high empathy may paradoxically also contribute to maintaining negative adolescent-parent interactions. Our research indicates that high empathy comes at a cost when adolescent-parent relationships are characterized by greater negativity.

We examined reciprocal effects between parents and children, mothers’ versus fathers’ unique roles in emotion regulation development, and sex differences. Multi-informant data allowed us to compare effects of adolescent-perceived and parent-reported parenting. Finally, innovative analyses allowed us to disentangle between-family differences from within-family predictive processes. Parenting and emotion regulation were associated at the between-family and within-family levels, especially according to adolescent reports. Support primarily played a role between mothers and adolescents, and perceived behavioral control between fathers and adolescents. Sex moderation revealed that support played a more prominent role in mother–daughter than mother–son relationships, and that daughters experienced greater behavioral control. Child effects outnumbered parent effects, which might reflect the increasing equality of adolescent–parent relationships. Finally, adolescent-perceived parenting was a stronger correlate of emotion regulation than parent-reports, suggesting that adolescents’ perceptions are a relevant source of information for research and practice. Consistent with the self-determination theory perspective on parenting, emotion regulation flourished when adolescents felt like mothers provided support, and fathers loosened behavioral control. These results are in line with the notion that mother–child relationships are supportive attachment relationships, whereas fathers provide “activation” relationships, challenging adolescents to regulate emotions autonomously by providing less explicit structure.

Here we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the experimental evidence that kindness interventions (for example, performing ‘random acts of kindness’) boost subjective well-being.

The effect was not moderated by sex, age, type of participant, intervention, control condition or outcome measure. There was no indication of publication bias. We discuss the limitations of the current literature, and recommend that future research test more specific theories of kindness: taking kindness-specific individual differences into account; distinguishing between the effects of kindness to specific categories of people; and considering a wider range of proximal and distal outcomes.

Adolescents' attention-seeking motives were examined as a mediator of these over-time associations. In line with this model's account of self-image failure, we also expected that narcissistic youth's attention-seeking should increase following experiences of ego threat, such as social rejection.

Surprisingly, few studies have investigated what role the extent to which fathers and mothers equally share childcare responsibilities plays in this transmission. Using data from 2,027 families in a Dutch prospective cohort study, our structural equation modelling analyses showed direct effects of equally sharing responsibilities for playful activities on children’s cognitive development. Additionally, our study yielded some evidence for the hypothesis that equally sharing responsibilities for playful activities mediates the impact of parents’ educational attainment on children’s cognitive development. This suggests that the extent to which fathers and mothers equally share childcare responsibilities functions as an underlying mechanism for maintaining social class disparities in children’s cognitive development. Our ﬁndings also suggest that policies and programmes that encourage fathers and mothers to equally share playful activities may help promote children’s cognitive development.",10/11/2019,11/12/2019 10:40,11/12/2019 10:40,11/12/2019 10:40,,,,,,,The Influence of Fathers and Mothers Equally Sharing Childcare Responsibilities on Children’s Cognitive Development from Early Childhood to School Age,,,,,,,en,,,,,Crossref,,,,C:\Users\lissa102\Zotero\storage\2F26Q3HZ\Keizer et al. - 2019 - The Influence of Fathers and Mothers Equally Shari.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
